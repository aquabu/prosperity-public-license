# Modification Notes

This is a modified version of the Prosperity License. It is a draft of possible terms for a CoMakery source code repository.

# The Prosperity Public License

Prosperity is a public `LICENSE` for open software that requires users who use your software for commercial purposes to limit their use to a period of days.  In other words, Prosperity works for software similar to how [Creative Commons' Attribution-NonCommercial License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) works for other creative work.  Software under Prosperity is free for noncommercial use, and offers a free, automatic, honor-system trial to commercial users.

Prosperity is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's Prosperity's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/licensezero/parity-public-license/issues/new) so we can fix it.

## Why?

You might choose Prosperity because you've written an application for creating work other than other software, and want to sell business licenses while allowing hobbyists, students, and charities to use for free.
